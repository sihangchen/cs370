The application will allow the user to create custom lists comprised of many supermarket items.



## 2 Process Description

**Inception Phase** 

Description: A general framework of the project is created after assessments of the demanded requirements, financial cost/risk, scale and scope are confirmed viable.

 Entrance Criteria: Project requirements and potential compensation 

Exit Criteria: Full assessment of the project conditions with confirmation of beneficial returns. If criteras cannot be met or are deemed detrimental, rejection/renegotiation of project.

**Elaboration Phase** 

Description: The primary purpose of this phase is to refine the framework generated within the Inception phase. Secondary requirements must be accounted for and incorporated into the design frame work. Additionally, risk mitigation must be undertaken prioritizing common, thus highest risk scenarios, of both technical and non-technical natures, culminating in creation of representative prototype implementations and their respective documentation . 

Entrance Criteria: Requirements, framework, supplementary designs and plans from previous phases. 

Exit Criteria: Finalized design concept.

**Construction Phase** 

Description: All established features are implemented through code and subjected to rigorous testing, ensuring that they fulfill requirements and work as intended. 

Entrance criteria: Finalized product design 

Exit criteria: Implementation is tested successfully, fulfilling all requirements and functional expectations

**Transition Phase** 

Activity description: During this phase the product is rolled out to the customers. The version of the product is kept under watch for any bugs that might affect user experience which were not discovered or addressed during the construction phase. During this phase the customers are further given the ability to communicate with the team via customer service. 

Entrance criteria: The initial current version of the product. 

Exit criteria: New release of the product if an update must be done upon receiving customer data.
